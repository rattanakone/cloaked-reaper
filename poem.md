# I Am The Reaper

**I am the Reaper.**

All things with heedful hook

*Silent* I gather.

Pale roses touched with the spring,

Tall corn in **summer**,

Fruits rich with autumn, and *frail* winter blossoms -

*Reaping, still reaping* -

All things with heedful hook

**Timely** I gather.

*I am the Sower.*

All the unbodied life

Runs through my seed-sheet.

*Atom with atom wed*,

Each quickening the other,

Fall through my hands, ever changing, *still changeless*

Ceaselessly sowing,

Life, incorruptible life,

Flows from my seed-sheet.

**Maker and breaker**,

*I am the ebb and the flood,*

Here and Hereafter.

Sped through the tangle and coil

Of infinite nature,

Viewless and soundless I fashion all being.

**Taker and giver**,

*I am the womb and the grave,*

**The Now and the Ever.**

-- *William Ernest Henley 1875*
